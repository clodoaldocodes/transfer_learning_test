# Transfer Learning com TensorFlow - README

This code was built solely for the purpose of studying transfer learning using a standard dataset. TensorFlow, NumPy, and Matplotlib were used for implementation. To run the code, simply use Google Colab, and everything should work seamlessly. Any contributions or discussions are welcome.

# Requirements
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
```
!pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

# How to Use
- Open the provided Jupyter notebook in Google Colab.
- Execute the cells in order to run the code.
- Explore the code and results to better understand transfer learning with TensorFlow.

# Customization
Feel free to experiment with different models, hyperparameters, or datasets. Contributions and discussions regarding improvements are encouraged.

# Note
This code is designed for educational purposes, and Google Colab is recommended for its seamless execution. For any questions or improvements, please open an issue or contribute through pull requests.

Happy learning!
